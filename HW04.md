For hw04 I have created new web service at path http://54.70.113.238:5000/getDistance/cincinnati/chicago, which accepts two cities
and gives distance and duration between them in JSON format.
For that i have used google's distance matrix api which acepts two city and return many things including distance and duration. I have 
parsed data given by google and extracted only distance and duration out of it. 

You can give city names in the path (http://54.70.113.238:5000/getDistance/cincinnati/chicago) just replace cincinnati and chicago.

To view on browser visit : http://54.70.113.238:8080/fibonacci/

And fill from city and to city field. Click on Find distance button. Output is showned there.

If you use browser make sure you turn on CORS. You can download plugin.
